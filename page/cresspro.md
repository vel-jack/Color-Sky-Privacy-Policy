 cress puzzle inspired from old school game blue turn. Here you have to make all the dots into petals.

Most of the levels are easy to complete. Because no fail cases. It makes you to feel everything is simple. But some levels contains simple logic to solve. Then your brain start to wake up. You will meet some blocks in this game. They are actually steps to level up your thoughts.
